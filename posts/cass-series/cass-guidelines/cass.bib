Historically, social transitioning prior to assessment was rare but it is becoming more common. Aim To identify and synthesise studies assessing the outcomes of social transition for children and adolescents (under 18) experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Methods A systematic review and narrative sythesis. Database searches (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were perfomed in April 2022. Studies reporting any outcome of social transition (full or partial) for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence were included. An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used to appraise study quality. Results Eleven studies were included (children (n=8) and adolescents (n=3)) and most were of low quality. The majority were from the US, featured community samples and cross-sectional analyses. Different comparator groups were used, and outcomes related to mental health and gender identity reported. Overall studies consistently reported no difference in mental health outcomes for children who socially transitioned across all comparators. Studies found mixed evidence for adolescents who socially transitioned. Conclusions It is difficult to assess the impact of social transition on children/adolescents due to the small volume and low quality of research in this area. Importantly, there are no prospective longitudinal studies with appropriate comparator groups assessing the impact of social transition on mental health or gender-related outcomes for children/adolescents. Professionals working in the area of gender identity and those seeking support should be aware of the absence of robust evidence of the benefits or harms of social transition for children and adolescents.

However, specific approaches or interventions are not recommended. Aim To identify and summarise evidence on the outcomes of psychosocial support interventions for children and adolescents (age 0-18) experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Methods Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Database searches (MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Web of Science) were performed in April 2022, with results assessed independently by two reviewers. Peer-reviewed articles reporting the results of studies measuring outcomes of psychosocial support interventions were included. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results Ten studies were included. Half were conducted in the US, with others from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Six were pre--post analyses or cohort studies, three were mixed methods, and one was a secondary analysis of intervention data from four trials. Most studies were of low quality. Most analyses of mental health and psychosocial outcomes showed either benefit or no change, with none indicating negative or adverse effects. Conclusions The small number of low-quality studies limits conclusions about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for children/adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Clarity on the intervention approach as well as the core outcomes would support the future aggregation of evidence. More robust methodology and reporting is required.

  abstract = {Since 2016 trans people in the UK, and particularly trans children, have experienced a sustained and escalating campaign to roll back trans freedoms, rights and access to healthcare. A series of legislative, politicized and media-driven campaigns have resulted in the year-by-year worsening of access to affirmative healthcare for trans children in the UK. This study examines publications from the NHS-commissioned `Cass Review' into children's gender services, seeking to better understand what is happening in trans children's healthcare in the UK. Inductive and deductive reflexive thematic analysis was applied to a collection of Cass Review publications related to trans children's healthcare published between January 2020 and May 2023. Four concerns are presented and explored: (1) prejudice; (2) cisnormative bias; (3) pathologization; and (4) inconsistent standards of evidence. Each of these concerns impacts the Cass Review's approach to trans children's healthcare, with negative repercussions for trans children's healthcare rights and well-being. The Cass Review itself can be understood as an example of cis-supremacy, within a cis-dominant healthcare system lacking accountability to trans communities. These findings draw attention to systemic barriers to effective healthcare policy, with relevance for trans healthcare across and beyond the UK.},

It was criticized for its arbitrary definitions of quality items in a commentary in 2010 in this journal. That commentary was cited 1,250 times through December 2016. We examined the citation history of this commentary in a random sample of 100 full papers citing it, according to the Web of Science. Of these, 96 were systematic reviews, none of which quoted the commentary directly. All but 2 of the 96 indirect quotations (98\%) portrayed the commentary as supporting use of the NOS in systematic reviews when, in fact, the opposite was the case. It appears that the vast majority of systematic review authors who cited this commentary did not read it. Journal reviewers and editors did not recognize and correct these major quotation errors. Authors should read each source they cite to make sure their direct and indirect quotations are accurate. Reviewers and editors should do a better job of checking citations and quotations for accuracy. It might help somewhat for commentaries to include abstracts, so that the basic content can be conveyed by PubMed and other bibliographic resources.},

However, little is currently known about the proportions accessing different types of care and treatment following referral. Aim This systematic review examines the range of care pathways of children/adolescents (under 18) referred to specialist gender or endocrinology services. Methods Database searches were performed (April 2022), with results assessed independently by two reviewers. Peer-reviewed articles providing data for numbers of children and/or adolescents at referral/assessment and their treatment pathways were included. A narrative approach to synthesis was used and where appropriate proportions were combined in a random-effects meta-analysis. Results 23 studies across nine countries were included, representing 6133 children and/or adolescents with a median age at assessment of 14--16 and overall a higher percentage of birth-registered females. Of those assessed, 36\% (95\% CI 27\% to 45\%) received puberty suppression, 51\% (95\% CI 40\% to 62\%) received masculinising or feminising hormones, 68\% (95\% CI 57\% to 77\%) received puberty suppression and/or hormones and 16\% (95\% CI 10\% to 24\%) received surgery. No study systematically reported information about the full pathway or psychological care received by children/adolescents. Follow-up in many studies was insufficient or unclear. Reasons for discontinuation were rarely provided. Conclusions Prospective studies with long-term follow-up reporting information about the full range of pathways are needed to understand what happens to children and adolescents referred to specialist gender services. Information about provision of psychological care is needed considering high rates of psychosocial difficulties in this population.PROSPERO registration number CRD42021289659.},

Services and practice guidelines are responding to these changes. Aim This systematic review examines the numbers and characteristics of children/adolescents (under 18) referred to specialist gender or endocrinology services. Methods Database searches were performed (April 2022), with results assessed independently by two reviewers. Peer-reviewed articles providing at least birth-registered sex or age at referral were included. Demographic, gender-related, mental health, neurodevelopmental conditions and adverse childhood experience data were extracted. A narrative approach to synthesis was used and where appropriate proportions were combined in a meta-analysis. Results 143 studies from 131 articles across 17 countries were included. There was a twofold to threefold increase in the number of referrals and a steady increase in birth-registered females being referred. There is inconsistent collection and reporting of key data across many of the studies. Approximately 60\% of children/adolescents referred to services had made steps to present themselves in their preferred gender. Just under 50\% of studies reported data on depression and/or anxiety and under 20\% reported data on other mental health issues and neurodevelopmental conditions. Changes in the characteristics of referrals over time were generally not reported. Conclusions Services need to capture, assess and respond to the potentially co-occurring complexities of children/adolescents being referred to specialist gender and endocrine services. Agreement on the core characteristics for collection at referral/assessment would help to ensure services are capturing data as well as developing pathways to meet the needs of these children.PROSPERO registration number CRD42021289659.},

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool was used to examine guideline quality. Results Twenty-three guidelines/clinical guidance publications (1998--2022) were identified (4 international, 3 regional and 16 national). The quality and methods reporting in these varied considerably. Few guidelines systematically reviewed empirical evidence, and links between evidence and recommendations were often unclear. Although most consulted with relevant stakeholders, including 10 which involved service users or user representatives, it was often unclear how this influenced recommendations and only two reported including children/adolescents and/or parents. Guidelines also lacked clarity about implementation. Two international guidelines (World Professional Association for Transgender Health and Endocrine Society) formed the basis for most other guidance, influencing their development and recommendations. Conclusions Most clinical guidance for managing children/adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence lacks an independent and evidence-based approach and information about how recommendations were developed.

AIM: To examine the recommendations about the management of children and/or adolescents (age 0-18) experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence in published guidelines or clinical guidance. A separate paper examines the quality and development of guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review and narrative synthesis. Databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were searched to April 2022 and web-based searches and contact with international experts continued to December 2022, with results assessed independently by two reviewers. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool was used to examine guideline quality. RESULTS: 23 guidelines/clinical guidance publications (1998-2022) were identified (4 international, 3 regional, 16 national). Guidelines describe a similar care pathway starting with psychosocial care for prepubertal children, puberty suppressants followed by hormones for eligible adolescents and surgical interventions as these adolescents enter adulthood. In general, there is consensus that adolescents should receive a multidisciplinary assessment, although clear guidance about the purpose or approach is lacking. There are differing recommendations about when and on what basis psychological and medical interventions should be offered. There is limited guidance about what psychological care should be provided, about the management of prepubertal children or those with a non-binary gender identity, nor about pathways between specialist gender services and other providers. CONCLUSIONS: Published guidance describes a similar care pathway; however, there is no current consensus about the purpose and process of assessment for children or adolescents with gender dysphoria/incongruence, or about when psychological or hormonal interventions should be offered and on what basis.

Robust evidence concerning risks and benefits is lacking and there is a need to aggregate evidence as new studies are published. Aim To identify and synthesise studies assessing the outcomes of puberty suppression in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Methods A systematic review and narrative synthesis. Database searches (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were performed in April 2022, with results assessed independently by two reviewers. An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used to appraise study quality. Only moderate-quality and high-quality studies were synthesised. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines were used. Results 11 cohort, 8 cross-sectional and 31 pre-post studies were included (n=50). One cross-sectional study was high quality, 25 studies were moderate quality (including 5 cohort studies) and 24 were low quality. Synthesis of moderate-quality and high-quality studies showed consistent evidence demonstrating efficacy for suppressing puberty. Height increased in multiple studies, although not in line with expected growth. Multiple studies reported reductions in bone density during treatment. Limited and/or inconsistent evidence was found in relation to gender dysphoria, psychological and psychosocial health, body satisfaction, cardiometabolic risk, cognitive development and fertility. Conclusions There is a lack of high-quality research assessing puberty suppression in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. No conclusions can be drawn about the impact on gender dysphoria, mental and psychosocial health or cognitive development. Bone health and height may be compromised during treatment.

  abstract = {Background Clinical guidelines outline the use of hormones for masculinisation/feminisation in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria or incongruence. Robust evidence concerning risks and benefits is lacking. There is a need to aggregate evidence as research becomes available. Aim Identify and synthesise studies assessing the outcomes of hormones for masculinisation/feminisation in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Methods Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were performed in April 2022, with results assessed independently by two reviewers. An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Cohort Studies was used to assess study quality. Moderate- and high-quality studies were synthesised. Results 12 cohort, 9 cross-sectional and 32 pre--post studies were included (n=53). One cohort study was high-quality. Other studies were moderate (n=33) and low-quality (n=19). Synthesis of high and moderate-quality studies showed consistent evidence demonstrating induction of puberty, although with varying feminising/masculinising effects. There was limited evidence regarding gender dysphoria, body satisfaction, psychosocial and cognitive outcomes, and fertility. Evidence from mainly pre--post studies with 12-month follow-up showed improvements in psychological outcomes. Inconsistent results were observed for height/growth, bone health and cardiometabolic effects. Most studies included adolescents who received puberty suppression, making it difficult to determine the effects of hormones alone. Conclusions There is a lack of high-quality research assessing the use of hormones in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria/incongruence. Moderate-quality evidence suggests mental health may be improved during treatment, but robust study is still required. For other outcomes, no conclusions can be drawn. More recent studies published since April 2022 until January 2024 also support the conclusions of this review.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021289659.},
