  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High compliance in wearing a mask is a crucial factor for stopping the transmission of COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, social media has been a key communication channel for citizens. This study focused on analyzing content from Twitter related to masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Twitter data were collected using the keyword "mask" from 27 June 2020 to 4 July 2020. The total number of tweets gathered were n = 452,430. A systematic random sample of 1\% (n = 4525) of tweets was analyzed using social network analysis. NodeXL (Social Media Research Foundation, California, CA, USA) was used to identify users ranked influential by betweenness centrality and was used to identify key hashtags and content. RESULTS: The overall shape of the network resembled a community network because there was a range of users conversing amongst each other in different clusters. It was found that a range of accounts were influential and/or mentioned within the network. These ranged from ordinary citizens, politicians, and popular culture figures. The most common theme and popular hashtags to emerge from the data encouraged the public to wear masks. CONCLUSION: Towards the end of June 2020, Twitter was utilized by the public to encourage others to wear masks and discussions around masks included a wide range of users.},

  abstract = {Background Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has led to increased discussions across online platforms. These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph‚Äôs vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0\% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.},

But Twitter is not so much a social network where the exchange of personal information is facilitated ‚Äì in fact, recent surveys state that it‚Äôs not very social at all with a large amount of inactive accounts and a low motivation of engaging in dialogues [1]. Twitter has rather evolved into a pool of constantly updating information streams consisting of links, short status updates, and eyewitness news. Among the millions of users, a small percentage is what is called the group of influencers or alpha users. They have a large, active audience that consumes and multiplies the content published by the influencer. Thus, an influencer‚Äôs content ‚Äì whether it is plain text or links ‚Äì is distributed in a number of micro-networks and receives attention from a large amount of users even though they might not even be direct followers of the influencer. The further the content is spread, the further the influence of the user reaches.},

  abstract = {This research presents a novel aggregating method for constructing an aggregated topic model that is composed of the topics with greater coherence than individual models. When generating a topic model, a number of parameters have to be specified. The resulting topics can be very general or very specific, which depend on the chosen parameters. In this study we investigate the process of aggregating multiple topic models generated using different parameters with a focus on whether combining the general and specific topics is able to increase topic coherence. We employ cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute the similarity among topics and combine them into an aggregated model when their similarity scores exceed a predefined threshold. The model is evaluated against the standard topics models generated by the latent Dirichlet allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation. Specifically we use the coherence of topics to compare the individual models that create aggregated models against those of the aggregated model and models generated by Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, respectively. The results demonstrate that the aggregated model outperforms those topic models at a statistically significant level in terms of topic coherence over an external corpus. We also make use of the aggregated topic model on social media data to validate the method in a realistic scenario and find that again it outperforms individual topic models.},

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the role of Twitter in identifying communities of influence when the ‚Äòground truth‚Äô is known. We consider the European Parliament (EP) Twitter users during a period of one year, in which they posted over 560,000 tweets. We represent the influence on Twitter by the number of retweets users get. We construct two networks of influence: (i) core, where both users are the EP members, and (ii) extended, where one user can be outside the EP. We compare the detected communities in both networks to the ‚Äòground truth‚Äô: the political group, country, and language of the EP members. The results show that the core network closely matches the political groups, while the extended network best reflects the country of origin. This provides empirical evidence that the formation of retweet networks and community detection are appropriate tools to reveal real-world relationships, and can be used to uncover hidden properties when the ‚Äòground truth‚Äô is not known.},

These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics‚Äîdensity, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users‚Äîare utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result.

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people globally for over 2 years. Changes in lifestyles due to the pandemic may cause psychosocial stressors for individuals and could lead to mental health problems. To provide high-quality mental health support, health care organizations need to identify COVID-19‚Äìspecific stressors and monitor the trends in the prevalence of those stressors. Objective: This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media data to identify the psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the trend in the prevalence of these stressors at different stages of the pandemic. Methods: We obtained a data set of 9266 Reddit posts from the subreddit \textbackslash rCOVID19\_support, from February 14, 2020, to July 19, 2021. We used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the topics that were mentioned on the subreddit and analyzed the trends in the prevalence of the topics. Lexicons were created for each of the topics and were used to identify the topics of each post. The prevalences of topics identified by the LDA and lexicon approaches were compared. Results: The LDA model identified 6 topics from the data set: (1) ‚Äúfear of coronavirus,‚Äù (2) ‚Äúproblems related to social relationships,‚Äù (3) ‚Äúmental health symptoms,‚Äù (4) ‚Äúfamily problems,‚Äù (5) ‚Äúeducational and occupational problems,‚Äù and (6) ‚Äúuncertainty on the development of pandemic.‚Äù According to the results, there was a significant decline in the number of posts about the ‚Äúfear of coronavirus‚Äù after vaccine distribution started. This suggests that the distribution of vaccines may have reduced the perceived risks of coronavirus. The prevalence of discussions on the uncertainty about the pandemic did not decline with the increase in the vaccinated population. In April 2021, when the Delta variant became prevalent in the United States, there was a significant increase in the number of posts about the uncertainty of pandemic development but no obvious effects on the topic of fear of the coronavirus. Conclusions: We created a dashboard to visualize the trend in the prevalence of topics about COVID-19‚Äìrelated stressors being discussed on a social media platform (Reddit). Our results provide insights into the prevalence of pandemic-related stressors during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The NLP techniques leveraged in this study could also be applied to analyze event-specific stressors in the future.},
