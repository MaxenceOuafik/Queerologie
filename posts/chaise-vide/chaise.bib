  abstract = {Issue: Inadequate training around gender-affirming care is a critical gap in health care and medical education that causes disparities and leads to injury for transgender, nonbinary, and other gender-diverse patients. In contrast to this widespread provider knowledge gap, gender-diverse patients bring critical knowledge from their own experiences to health care. Embracing varied epistemologies, or sources of knowledge, within medical education has the potential to enhance gender-affirming care by intentionally placing value on the lived experiences and emphasizing the credibility of gender-diverse patients. Evidence: In this article, the authors endorse a model of epistemic peerhood in which the embodied knowledge of gender-diverse patients and the authoritative knowledge of providers are each valued for their contribution to care. The authors reflect on experiences developing gender-affirming healthcare curricula and how medical education has not yet adequately addressed gender-diverse care without embracing community knowledge. Implications: The authors identify three vital areas to integrate epistemic peerhood in medical training to address gaps in gender-affirming care: (1) collaborative student training methods that reflect embodied knowledge in the absence of, or in addition to, clinical expertise on gender-affirming care; (2) sustainable partnerships between academic programs and gender-diverse communities that foster continuous engagement from collaborators with lived experience; and (3) broad community input about best practices for representing gender diversity in patient simulation. Embracing epistemic peerhood in each of these areas would result in broader gender-diverse community representation and leadership in medical education, which would ultimately strengthen gender-affirming healthcare training.},

  abstract = {Globally, as medical and mental health associations increasingly have expressed support for the gender-affirming care model for trans and gender expansive youth, this model has been paradoxically banned across the United States. Ban proponents have deemed the science behind gender-affirming care to be dangerously uncertain. Examining the first gender-affirming care ban for minors, Arkansas's Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act of 2021, we addressed the following two questions: 1) who are the scientists, clinicians, and political organizations that promote SAFE and similar bans?; and 2) what are the scientific arguments they make to defend SAFE in federal court? First, we developed a typology of the various "agents of scientific uncertainty" behind these bans, drawing on literature from the sociology and history of science and medicine as well as the political economy of scientific doubt. Second, we created and qualitatively analyzed a dataset featuring 375 unique citations referenced throughout federal litigation over SAFE to identify these agents of scientific uncertainty's arguments. We sorted these arguments into eight categories, which reveal how agents distorted scientific evidence and exaggerated real uncertainties and risks in gender-affirming care. This case study establishes a frame for understanding the growing prevalence and legal impact of scientific arguments against gender-affirming care.},
